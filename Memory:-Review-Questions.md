## Q
What are the following and what is their purpose?
* Translation Lookaside Buffer
* Physical Address
* Memory Management Unit
* The dirty bit

## Q
How do you determine how many bits are used in the page offset?

## Q
20 ms after a context switch the TLB contains all logical addresses used by your numerical code which performs main memory access 100% of the time. What is the overhead (slowdown) of a two-level page table compared to a single-level page table?

## Q
Explain why the TLB must be flushed when a context switch occurs (i.e. the CPU is assigned to work on a different process).
