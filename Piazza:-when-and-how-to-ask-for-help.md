### Purpose ###
TAs and student assistants get a ton of questions. Some are well-researched, and some...are not. This is a handy guide that'll help you move away from the latter and towards the former. (Oh, and did I mention that this is an easy way to score points with your internship managers?)

1. Am I running on EWS?
2. Did I check the man pages?
3. Are all my includes good?
4. Did I google the error message (and a few permutations thereof if necessary)?
5. Did I try commenting out parts of the code bit by bit to find out precisely where the error occurs?
6. Did I commit my code to SVN in case the TAs need more context?
7.Did I include the console/GDB/Valgrind output + code surrounding the bug in my Piazza post?
