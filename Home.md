Welcome to Angrave's crowd-sourced System Programming wiki!
This wiki is being built by students at UIUC.

Rather than requiring a book this semester, we will build own set of resources here.

We need pages on 
* Process Memory Layout for a single-threaded process (code, bss, data, heap, stack, args, env)
* Process Control (fork, exec, wait, pid, ppid,exit examples)
* File Control (open,seek,close,dup, stat examples)
* IPC (pipes)
* pThreads (pthread_exit, pthread_join)
* Deadlock (conditions, Peterson,Dekker's alg etc)
* Synchronization primitives (mutex, counting semaphore, condition variable + examples of each)
* Synchronization concepts (Philosophers, Reader-Writer, Producer-Consumer)
* Signals
* Scheduling
* Virtual Memory (paging, mmap)
