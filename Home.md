Welcome to Angrave's crowd-sourced System Programming wiki!
This wiki is being built by students and faculty from UIUC.

Rather than requiring a book this semester, we will build our own set of resources here.


## Week 1
* [[C Programming]]
* [[C Gotchas wiki page|C-Programming---Common-Gotchas]]
* [[Informal Glossary of basic terms|Informal Glossary]]

## Week 2
* [[C Programming Text Input Output]]
* [[forking processes]]
* [[fork exec wait kill]]
* For fun: [[Smashing the stack example]]

## Week 3
* [[Heap Memory Introduction]]
* [[Implementing a Memory Allocator]]
* [[Threads Introduction to pthreads|Pthreads Part 1]]

## Week 4
* [[Pthreads Part 2]]
* [[Introduction to Mutex Lock|Mutex-Locks-Part-1]]
* [[Introduction to Counting Semaphores|Counting-Semaphores---Part-1]]

## Other content

* [[Debugging C Programs]]

Call to action --
We need pages or examples on 
* Process Memory Layout for a single-threaded process (code, bss, data, heap, stack, args, env)
* Process Control (fork, exec, wait, pid, ppid,exit examples)
* File Control (open,seek,close,dup, stat examples)
* IPC (pipes)
* pThreads (pthread_exit, pthread_join)
* Deadlock (conditions, Peterson,Dekker's alg etc)
* Synchronization primitives (mutex, counting semaphore, condition variable + examples of each)
* Synchronization concepts (Philosophers, Reader-Writer, Producer-Consumer)
* Signals
* Scheduling
* Virtual Memory (paging, mmap)
